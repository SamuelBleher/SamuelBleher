# Hi there 👋, I'm Samuel Bleher

🎓 **M.Sc. in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence**  
👨‍💻 **Aerospace Engineering Background**  
🎿 **Professional Ski Instructor**  
📍 Based in Germany  

### About Me

I'm passionate about leveraging **UAVs/FPV drones**, **robotics**, and **computer vision** to solve real-world problems. With a strong foundation in aerospace engineering, I am currently pursuing a Master's in **Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence**, combining these disciplines to push the boundaries of what's possible.

When I'm not working on technology, you'll likely find me skiing down mountains as a **professional ski instructor** or traveling the world, discovering new cultures and experiences.

### What I'm Working On

- **UAVs & Drones**: Developing and optimizing UAV systems for autonomous flight and control.
- **Robotics & Computer Vision**: Exploring new frontiers in robot perception and intelligent systems.
- **PX4 & Embedded Systems**: Deep diving into PX4 for UAV control and integrating advanced sensor data (e.g., UWB).
